# Regex Tutorial

Welcome to the Regex Tutorial! This project is designed to help web development students and enthusiasts understand the components of a specific regular expression (regex) through a detailed breakdown and examples.

## Description

This project is a comprehensive tutorial designed to help web development students understand a specific regular expression (regex). The tutorial breaks down the components of the regex, explains their purpose, and provides examples to demonstrate how they work. By the end of the tutorial, you will have a clear understanding of the search pattern the regex defines.

## User Story

**AS A** web development student  
**I WANT** a tutorial explaining a specific regex  
**SO THAT** I can understand the search pattern the regex defines  

## Acceptance Criteria

- **GIVEN** a regex tutorial  
  - **WHEN** I open the tutorial  
    - **THEN** I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile.  
  - **WHEN** I click on the links in the table of contents  
    - **THEN** I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial.  
  - **WHEN** I read through each section of the tutorial  
    - **THEN** I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does.

    - **THEN** I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile.  

## Instructions 

1. **Choose a Regex**:  
   Select a specific regular expression that you want to explain. For example, `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/` for validating email addresses.

2. **Break Down the Regex**:  
   Analyze the regex and identify its components, such as anchors, quantifiers, character classes, grouping, etc.

3. **Write the Tutorial**:  
   - Start with a descriptive title and an introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial.
   - Provide a summary of the regex and its use case.
   - Create a table of contents linking to sections that explain each component of the regex.

4. **Explain Each Component**:  
   For each section in the table of contents:
   - Describe the component (e.g., anchors, quantifiers).
   - Provide examples of how it works.
   - Explain its purpose in the context of the regex.

5. **Add Examples**:  
   Include code snippets or text examples to demonstrate how the regex works in real-world scenarios.

6. **Include an Author Section**:  
   Add a section about the author with a link to their GitHub profile.

7. **Save the Tutorial**:  
   Save the tutorial as a Markdown file (e.g., `gist-template.md`) in your project directory.
